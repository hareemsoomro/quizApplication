# Quiz Application
Clean and easy UI Using HTML CSS Bootstrap and Javascript
I have used local storage for getting the player's data.
I have added the score boared option on the top where the user will be able to see the his/her scores at any time.
The Player will have 10 seconds for each question.
If the player miss the question it will be cosidered as wrong answer.
after quiz there will be a setion which will render to show the user name with secured scored.
